/*
 The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

 If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
 If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
 If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
 Otherwise, just print the number.
